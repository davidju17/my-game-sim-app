# Tic Tac Toe Game in React

## Description
This is a React-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game and a demonstration of my skills in modern web development. Building this project required a solid understanding of React for the interactive UI components, as well as proficiency in CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. The project showcases component-based architecture, state management, and responsive design—all of which are key skills for any React developer.

## Rules
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty squares with either "X" or "O". The goal is to be the first to align three of your marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine squares are filled and no player achieves this, the match ends in a tie.

## Features
* Customizable Player Names: Users can edit the default player names before starting the game to personalize their experience.

* Interactive Gameplay: Players take turns marking squares on a responsive 3x3 grid.

* Win or Tie Detection: The game automatically detects when a player wins or when the match ends in a tie.

* Replayability: Restart the game as many times as you want to enjoy endless rounds.
